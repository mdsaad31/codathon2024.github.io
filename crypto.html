    <h1>Basic Aspects of Cryptocurrencies</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>INTRODUCTION</li>
        <ul>

            <li>Cryptocurrencies are a new concept in the global economy. 
                They exist only for approximately five years and they already 
                attracted a lot of attention. Especially, since the year 2013 they 
                experience turbulent changes in their exchange rates. The 
                cryptocurrencies belong to the group of virtual currencies. We 
                can consider cryptocurrency as a digital medium of exchange, 
                based on principles of cryptography allowing performance of
                secure, decentralized and distributed economic transactions [1].</li><br>
            <li>Theoretical foundations of cryptocurrencies were outlined 
                by Chaum [2] for the first time in 1983 already. The 
                cryptocurrencies integrate electronic virtual money with 
            principles of cryptography [2]. The basic principle of 
            cryptocurrency is that no individual (or organization) may 
            accelerate or significantly abuse the production of a given 
            currency. Typically only a certain predefined amount of 
            cryptocurrency is collectively produced by the entire 
            cryptocurrency system. The rate of production is set by a value 
            defined in prior and is publicly known [3]. The 
            cryptocurrencies allows virtually costless transfers of 
            cryptocurrency units (referred as coins) between client 
            applications via computer peer-to-peer network [2].</li><br>
            <li>The most famous cryptocurrency and the first to be 
                introduced was Bitcoin in 2009. It was designed by a person or 
                a group of persons hiding under pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto 
                [4]. Two types of Bitcoin users exist: ordinary users and so 
                called Bitcoin miners. Ordinary users of Bitcoin use digital 
                wallet similar to electronic banking applications. The wallet is 
                software for a management of Bitcoin cash, thus for sending 
                and receiving payments in bitcoins. Bitcoins exist only as
                information in files in a computer or a mobile device. Access to 
                these files is restricted to the holder of private key, which is
                used to secure the money. If file system in the computer is 
                damaged or the wallet file is inadvertently deleted, then the 
                wallet file is lost and the bitcoins it contained are lost forever
                (in case that the wallet file was not backed up). Although the 
                public address of wallet still exists, it can only be accessed by 
                the private key, which was deleted. Unless one breaks the very 
                secure encryption built into the system, then it would not be 
                possible to recover the lost coins and breaking encryption used 
                by Bitcoin network by a force is virtually impossible in timely 
                manner [3].</li>
